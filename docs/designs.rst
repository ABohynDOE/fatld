Constructing a design
+++++++++++++++++++++

When constructing a design with four-level factors and two-level factors, the four-level factors are always constructed from pairs of basic factors.
The two-level factors in the design include the remaining basic factors (if any) and the added factors.
The figure below details this process for a 64-run design with 2 four-level factors, 2 basic two-level factors and 5 added two-level factors.

Only the column numbers of the added factors are given in the catalog.
But, as the figure shows, it is simple to reconstruct any design only from the added factors, given its run size.
