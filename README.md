# Four And Two Level Designs

[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/fatld.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/fatld)

The `fatld` package contains functionality to generate and characterize designs with four-and-two-level (FATL) factors.
Design characteristics include word length pattern, defining relation, and number of clear interactions.
For more information about the package see the documentation at [https://abohyndoe.github.io/fatld/](https://abohyndoe.github.io/fatld/).
A large collection of FATL designs can be explored interactively using a web app at [https://abohyndoe.shinyapps.io/fatldesign-selection-tool/](https://abohyndoe.shinyapps.io/fatldesign-selection-tool/).

## Usage

The package can be used from Python:

```python
>>> import fatld
>>> D = fatld.Design(runsize=32, m=1, cols=[21, 27, 29])
>>> D.wlp()
[1, 3, 3, 0, 0]
>>> D.defining_relation()
['A1cef', 'A3deg', 'A1cdeh']
>>> print("There are %s 2-2 interactions totally clear from any main effect or other interaction." % D.clear('2-2', 'all'))
There are 6 2-2 interactions totally clear from any main effect or other interaction.
>>> print("The design contains %s four-level factors and %s two-level factors" % (D.m, D.n))
The design contains 1 four-level factors and 6 two-level factors
```

For more examples see the documentation.

## Installation

The Python interface to the package is available on pypi. Installation can be done using the following command:

```bash
pip install fatld
```

## Development

All development is done in a virtual environment based on `poetry`, activate it using:

```shell
poetry shell
```

### Code style

* Try to follow the [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guide. A usefull tool for automated formatting is [black](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/black). We do allow lines upto 120 characters.
* Document functions using the [Numpy docstring](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_numpy.html#example-numpy) convention

* Linting is based on `ruff`, configuration is found in the [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml) file.

* Tests are ran using `pytest` and a coverage report can be generated using `coverage` inside the virtual environment:

    ```shell
    coverage run -m pytest tests
    coverage report -m
    ```
